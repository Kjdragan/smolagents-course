# **Project Documentation & Logging Guidelines**


### **Tracking & Reviewing Project Edits**
For tracking recent edits, append to:
- **Edit Log:**
  `C:\Users\kevin\repos\fresh_client\windsurf-log.md`
- **Other Project Documentation:**
  - `C:\Users\kevin\repos\fresh_client\Project Documentation\1.MCP_Client_Project_Description.md`
  - `C:\Users\kevin\repos\fresh_client\Project Documentation\2.Client_Project_Lessons_Learned.md`
  - `C:\Users\kevin\repos\fresh_client\Project Documentation\3.ProjectContext.md`

### **Documentation Update Schedule**
- **Every 30 minutes** during active project sessions if needed.
- **Upon user request** for specific updates.
- **Avoid unnecessary updates** if the documents are already current unless instructed otherwise.
- **ASK BEFORE PERFORMING THE UPDATE** make sure to ask the user if they want you to perform the update now.

Keeping all documentation up to date ensures an accurate project history.

## **Windsurf Log Maintenance**
The **"windsurf-log-#.md"** document is used for tracking and reviewing recent project edits. This should only be updated in the following cases:
- **Every 30 minutes** during active project sessions if needed.
- **Upon user request** for specific updates.
- **Avoid unnecessary updates** if the documents are already current unless instructed otherwise.
- **ASK BEFORE PERFORMING THE UPDATE** make sure to ask the user if they want you to perform the update now.

### **Log Storage & Structure**
- **Single Location:**
  C:\Users\kevin\repos\openai-sdk-agent\OTHER\project_documentation\windsurf-log.md
- **Maintain only one active log at a time.**
- **New log file creation:**
  - **Start a new log when the current one exceeds 600 lines.**
  - Use **incremental numbering** for new logs:
    - First file: `windsurf-log-1.md`
    - Next files: `windsurf-log-2.md`, `windsurf-log-3.md`, etc.
- **No duplicate logs** in different directories (previously stored in both root and `src/`â€”discontinue this practice).

### **Log Format**
Each log entry should follow a structured format:

```markdown
## [Current Date & Time] Regarding this: The user doesn't want me to run Get-Date commands to get the current time for logs. Instead, I should use the timestamp that's already provided in the ADDITIONAL_METADATA section

I'll use this time to update both windsurf-log.md files without making additional terminal commands to get the date/time.

- Change Description 1
  - Specific details or context
  - Lessons learned
  - File path affected

- Change Description 2
  - Specific details or context
  - Lessons learned
  - File path affected
```

### **Documentation Logging Best Practices**
Each entry must include:
1. **Bullet points** for each change.
2. **Relevant file paths** and descriptions.
3. **Context or reasoning** when necessary.
4. **Grouped related changes** under a single timestamp.
5. **Chronological order** for clear tracking.
6. **Concise yet detailed descriptions** of modifications.
7. **Sufficient information** for future reference.
8. **Clear headers** separating different days' entries.
